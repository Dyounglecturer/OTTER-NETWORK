The quiz was lively and so interactive, students were amazed by several information about otter that was embedded in the quiz. Four schools participated in the quiz competition with Daarul-Hikmah topping with 19 points out of 20 points. Crescent achieved 12 points Manifest with 9 points and Al-Minteeqy having a point.
The students dispersed for a 15-minute break afterwards and converge for the Pick and talk session. 
PICK AND TALK 
This session involved some crafted questions about Otter and Environmental conservation, six topics was rolled out for the schools to choose from. The topics are listed as follows:
1.	The Role of Otters in Ecosystem Health: Discuss how otters contribute to maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems and their impact on biodiversity.
2.	Threats to Otter Populations: Explore the various threats otters face, such as habitat destruction, pollution, and illegal trade, and discuss potential solutions.
3.	Conservation Success Stories: Share and discuss successful otter conservation projects from around the world, highlighting what made them effective.
4.	The Importance of Wetland Conservation: Examine the role of wetlands in supporting Otter populations and the broader environmental benefits of wetland conservation.

This session drove tension among the students, they were granted the chance to discuss with their teachers and fellow participants. A presenter was push forward to represent each school. 
They were judged by the English teachers present on 4 Criteria namely.
1.	Content
2.	Organization 
3.	Composure
4.	Expression
This session saw a close gap between Daarul-Hikmah and Manifest with both schools scoring 23.5 and 22.5 out of the 30 marks achievable in this session. Other schools also did excellently well.
OTTER SPEECH
This was the last segment of the competition. The aim was to build Otter advocates among the students. They are meant to give a general speech about otter and advocate for the preservation of the specie. Daarul-Hikmah and Manifest representatives did excellently beyond our expectations. We all felt connected to the endangered species. 
CALL FOR MEMBERSHIP
At the end of the competition, We introduced Nigerian Otter Network to the students and their teachers, we emphasize on the need to join the cause and be a driver to achieve sustainable Otter and Environmental conservation. A student has shown interest to become a member and be part of the Nigerian otter network. Schools have also shown interest to always answer our calls whenever we plan to host similar events in future.
SHARING OF PRIZES AND GIFTS FOR SCHOOLS
We donated a waste bin for each school and prize was given to the First, Second and Third position. Daarul-Hikmah top with a total point of 96, Manifest with 31 points and An-Nuur with 23 points. One would wonder why the wide margin between the first and second positions? The answer is; Daarul-Hikmah have hosted the World Otter Day events, so they are already Otter advocates. Other schools are just participating for the first time. I believe subsequent one would be more closer than this.
MENU! MENU!!
Light pastries and zobo drinks was served to all students in attendance. Staffs was served with Maltina and Biscuits while the students interacts with one another using scrabble game. 
GROUP PHOTOGRAPHS
We all converge for group photographs and call it a day
